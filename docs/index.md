Welcome to my private snippets collection. My name is Alex and I work as a software developer. 

Because I find myself having to do the same things over and over again, it made sense to take notes.
After sharing my notes with more and more friends and colleagues, I thought why not take it a step further and publish them on GitHub.

Maybe someone else will find something useful or can even contribute or give feedback.
